# Emergency Ship Hull Repair: Complete Area Coverage and Self-Assembly
Codes and videos associated with the doctoral research project concerning Emergency Ship Hull Repair using a Swarm of Autonomous Underwater Robots.

Netlogo was used for the Self-assembly algorithm simulations. Two files are included under the Self-Assembly folder:
ESHR SA Experiment 1 and ESHR SA Experiment 2
These can be files can either be downloaded and executed on the Netlogo Desktop App or uploaded and executed in a browser using Netlogo Web. Links for which can be found here: https://www.netlogoweb.org/

In addition, a video of the first iteration of self-assembly is included:
Netlogo ESHR Self-Assembly.mp4

Webots was used for the Search algorithm simulations. Six programs for use with Webots, and one video file are included:

The robot and supervisor programs needed for the Partial Population Failure (PPF) experiments in Approach 1 can be found in the Complete Area Coverage folder:
SHIR_A1_SUP_PPF_10.c and SHIR_A1_ROB_PPF.c
While the world file required to set up the environment is listed in the top directory as:
SHI_A1_PPF_10.wbt

The robot and supervisor programs needed for the Partial Population Failure (PPF) experiments in Approach 2 can be found in the Complete Area Coverage folder:
SHIR_A2_SUP_PPF_10.c and SHIR_A2_CON.c
While the world file required to set up the environment is listed in the top directory as:
SHI_A2_PPF_10.wbt

These files can be downloaded and executed on the Open Source Webots Desktop App, which can be accessed here: https://www.cyberbotics.com/download/download

The video file shows the robots carrying out an emergency ship hull inspection using the sweeping search under ideal conditions:
