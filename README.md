# Emergency-Ship-Hull-Repair
Codes and videos associated with the doctoral research project: Emergency Ship Hull Repair using a Swarm of Autonomous Underwater Robots.

Netlogo was used for the Self-assembly algorithm simulations. Two files are included:

ESHR SA Experiment 1 and ESHR SA Experiment 2

These can be files can either be downloaded and executed on the Netlogo Desktop App or uploaded and executed in a browser using Netlogo Web. Links for which can be found here: https://www.netlogoweb.org/

Webots was used for the Search algorithm simulations. Six programs for use with Webots, and one video file are included:

The programs needed for the Partial Population Failure (PPF) experiments in Approach 1 are:
SHI_A1_PPF_10.wbt	
SHIR_A1_SUP_PPF_10.c
SHIR_A1_ROB_PPF.c

The programs needed for the Partial Population Failure (PPF) experiments in Approach 2 are:
SHI_A2_PPF_10.wbt	
SHIR_A2_SUP_PPF_10.c	
SHIR_A2_CON.c

These files can be downloaded and executed on the Webots Desktop App, which can be accessed here: https://www.cyberbotics.com/download/download

The video file shows the robots carrying out an emergency ship hull inspection under ideal conditions:
